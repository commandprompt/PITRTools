cmd_standby expects two configuration files in this directory, namely

- postgresql.conf
- pg_hba.conf

They will be used to start PostgreSQL in standby mode. By default these
configuration files will be copied from pitrtools/pg_conf/ to PostgreSQL
data folder. However, you can configure cmd_standby to use them directly
from pg_conf/ without first copying to the data folder.

Use no_copy_conf: parameter in cmd_standby.ini to control how
these files will be used.
